Important:
Make it cross-platform (not just Windows)

Write test for everything possible




make Figure notseen, also constructors of Figure

make everything unneeded outside private

Change info in readme - for Composed Figures don't declare the Visualize(), but InitializeFigures() which should be added to new inheriting interface

no check for duplicate keys of figures in collection

Add functionallity to choose how often the update method is called, UpdateMethod factory, etc.

add clear color for image

Unimportant:
- all translate, rotate, etc. for figure and composed figure should be done only if need (for example no rotation at 0 degrees) also make them in seperate method to reuse in both structs
